## Abstract

The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein mediates viral attachment to
ACE2 receptor and is a major determinant of host range and a dominant target of neutralizing antibodies.
Here, we experimentally measure how all amino acid mutations to the RBD affect expression of folded protein
and its affinity for ACE2. Most mutations are deleterious for RBD expression and ACE2 binding, and we identify constrained regions on the RBDâ€™s surface that may be desirable targets for vaccines and antibody-based
therapeutics. But a substantial number of mutations are well tolerated or even enhance ACE2 binding,
including at ACE2 interface residues that vary across SARS-related coronaviruses. However, we find no evidence that these ACE2-affinity-enhancing mutations have been selected in current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic
isolates. We present an interactive visualization and open analysis pipeline to facilitate use of our dataset for
vaccine design and functional annotation of mutations observed during viral surveillance.
