## Abstract

Influenza virus can escape most antibodies with single mutations. However, rare antibodies
broadly neutralize many viral strains. It is unclear how easily influenza virus might escape
such antibodies if there was strong pressure to do so. Here, we map all single amino-acid
mutations that increase resistance to broad antibodies to H1 hemagglutinin. Our approach
not only identifies antigenic mutations but also quantifies their effect sizes. All antibodies
select mutations, but the effect sizes vary widely. The virus can escape a broad antibody to
hemagglutinin’s receptor-binding site the same way it escapes narrow strain-specific
antibodies: via single mutations with huge effects. In contrast, broad antibodies to
hemagglutinin’s stalk only select mutations with small effects. Therefore, among the
antibodies we examine, breadth is an imperfect indicator of the potential for viral escape via
single mutations. Antibodies targeting the H1 hemagglutinin stalk are quantifiably harder to
escape than the other antibodies tested here.
