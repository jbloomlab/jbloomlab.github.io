## Abstract

Influenza is one of the best-studied viruses of all time, and as such, it serves as a testbed to extend our biological knowledge to the nanoscale. Many of the key processes underlying influenza infection and our antibody response against the virus have been thoroughly investigated. This SnapShot describes these key numbers for prototypical lab-adapted strains of the human influenza A virus. To view this SnapShot, open or download the PDF.
