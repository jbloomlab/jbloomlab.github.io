## Abstract

SARS-CoV-2 is under strong evolutionary selection to acquire mutations in its spike protein that reduce neutralization by human polyclonal antibodies. Here we use pseudovirus-based deep mutational scanning to measure how mutations to the spike from the recent KP.3.1.1 SARS-CoV-2 strain affect cell entry, binding to ACE2 receptor, RBD up/down motion, and neutralization by human sera and clinically relevant antibodies. The spike mutations that most affect serum antibody neutralization sometimes differ between sera collected before versus after recent vaccination or infection, indicating these exposures shift the neutralization immunodominance hierarchy. The sites where mutations cause the greatest reduction in neutralization by post-vaccination or infection sera include receptor-binding domain (RBD) sites 475, 478 and 487, all of which have mutated in recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. Multiple mutations outside the RBD affect sera neutralization as strongly as any RBD mutations by modulating RBD up/down movement. Some sites that affect RBD up/down movement have mutated in recent SARS-CoV-2 variants. Finally, we measure how spike mutations affect neutralization by three clinically relevant SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: VYD222, BD55-1205, and SA55. Overall, these results illuminate the current constraints and pressures shaping SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and can help with efforts to forecast possible future antigenic changes that may impact vaccines or clinical antibodies.
