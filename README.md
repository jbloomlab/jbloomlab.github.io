# `vitepress-theme-lab-website`

I created `vitepress-theme-lab-website` to take advantage of the [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/guide/what-is-vitepress) ecosystem to make a theme for academic lab websites. [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/guide/what-is-vitepress) is typically used to build aesthetically pleasing documentation; however, its features are nicely suited to any content-driven static website (i.e. documentation, blogs, portfolios, and *lab websites*). This template repository provides the necessary code and instructions for creating and hosting your own lab website with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/guide/what-is-vitepress).
