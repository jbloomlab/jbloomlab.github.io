Using dms_tools, one can infer the preference of each site for each amino acid given a single selection pressure, or assess the extent to which these preferences change under different selection pressures.",-1),l=[i,r,c];function d(m,p,f,h,u,_){return o(),a("div",null,l)}const k=t(n,[["render",d]]);export{g as __pageData,k as default};
