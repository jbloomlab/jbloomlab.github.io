Resistance mutations are often identified one-at-a-time by studying viral evolution within treated patients or during viral growth in the presence of a drug in cell culture. Such approaches have previously mapped resistance to enfuvirtide, the only clinically approved HIV-1 fusion inhibitor, to enfuvirtide’s binding site in the N-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) of the Envelope (Env) transmembrane domain as well as a limited number of allosteric sites. Here, we sought to better delineate the genotypic determinants of resistance throughout Env. We used deep mutational scanning to quantify the effect of all single-amino-acid mutations to the subtype A BG505 Env on resistance to enfuvirtide. We identified both previously characterized and numerous novel resistance mutations in the NHR. Additional resistance mutations clustered in other regions of Env conformational intermediates, suggesting they may act during different fusion steps by altering fusion kinetics and/or exposure of the enfuvirtide binding site. This complete map of resistance sheds light on the diverse mechanisms of enfuvirtide resistance and highlights the utility of using deep mutational scanning to comprehensively map potential drug resistance mutations.",-1),d=[o,r];function l(c,u,h,p,f,m){return n(),i("div",null,d)}const _=t(s,[["render",l]]);export{v as __pageData,_ as default};
