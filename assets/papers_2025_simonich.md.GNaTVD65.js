Some other viral proteins evolve to erode polyclonal antibody neutralization and escape individual monoclonal antibodies. However, little is known about how RSV F evolution affects antibodies. Here we develop an experimental system for measuring neutralization titers against RSV F using pseudotyped lentiviral particles. This system is easily adaptable to evaluate neutralization of relevant clinical strains. We apply this system to demonstrate that natural evolution of RSV F leads to escape from some monoclonal antibodies, but at most modestly affects neutralization by polyclonal serum antibodies. Overall, our work sheds light on RSV antigenic evolution and describes a tool to measure the ability of antibodies and sera to neutralize contemporary RSV strains.",-1),l=[s,r];function c(d,p,m,u,h,b){return o(),t("div",null,l)}const f=a(i,[["render",c]]);export{_ as __pageData,f as default};
