Identifying drug resistance mutations can guide the clinical deployment of the antiviral and can additionally define the mechanisms of drug action and drug resistance. Pimodivir is a first-in-class inhibitor of the polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2) subunit of the influenza A virus polymerase complex. A number of resistance mutations have previously been identified in treated patients or cell culture. Here, we generate a complete map of the effect of all single-amino-acid mutations to an avian PB2 on resistance to pimodivir. We identified both known and novel resistance mutations not only in the previously implicated cap-binding and mid-link domains, but also in the N-terminal domain. Our complete map of pimodivir resistance thus enables the evaluation of whether new viral strains contain mutations that will confer pimodivir resistance.",-1),l=[s,r];function c(d,p,h,m,u,f){return a(),t("div",null,l)}const b=i(o,[["render",c]]);export{_ as __pageData,b as default};
