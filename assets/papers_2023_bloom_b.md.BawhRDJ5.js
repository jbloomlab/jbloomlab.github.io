Here, we examine whether this mutational process itself has changed during viral evolution. To do this, we quantify the relative rates of different types of single-nucleotide mutations at 4-fold degenerate sites in the viral genome across millions of human SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We find clear shifts in the relative rates of several types of mutations during SARS-CoV-2 evolution. The most striking trend is a roughly 2-fold decrease in the relative rate of G→T mutations in Omicron versus early clades, as was recently noted by Ruis et al. (2022. Mutational spectra distinguish SARS-CoV-2 replication niches. bioRxiv, doi:10.1101/2022.09.27.509649). There is also a decrease in the relative rate of C→T mutations in Delta, and other subtle changes in the mutation spectrum along the phylogeny. We speculate that these changes in the mutation spectrum could arise from viral mutations that affect genome replication, packaging, and antagonization of host innate-immune factors, although environmental factors could also play a role. Interestingly, the mutation spectrum of Omicron is more similar than that of earlier SARS-CoV-2 clades to the spectrum that shaped the long-term evolution of sarbecoviruses. Overall, our work shows that the mutation process is itself a dynamic variable during SARS-CoV-2 evolution and suggests that human SARS-CoV-2 may be trending toward a mutation spectrum more similar to that of other animal sarbecoviruses.",-1),l=[r,n];function c(h,m,u,d,p,f){return o(),a("div",null,l)}const _=t(i,[["render",c]]);export{g as __pageData,_ as default};
