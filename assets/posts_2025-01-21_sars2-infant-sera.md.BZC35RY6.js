This imprinting has been shown to play an important role in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38749479/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">shaping</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05644-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">antibody</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38345-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">repertoires</a> to SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>Most of the global population was imprinted by the spike of an early SARS-CoV-2 strain: either they were vaccinated with the original COVID-19 vaccine that contained the Wuhan-Hu-1 strain, or they were infected in 2020 or 2021 by a similar viral variant. However, a small but growing fraction of the population has instead been imprinted by a more recent viral strain. This fraction of the population consists largely of infants who were first exposed to later viral variants.</p><p>In our study, we worked with the groups of Mary Staat (Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital) and Helen Chu (University of Washington) to compare the polyclonal serum neutralizing antibodies in adults that had been imprinted by an early SARS-CoV-2 strain and then infected with a XBB* variant in 2023, versus infants who had only been infected with a XBB* variant in 2023.</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="imprinting_cohorts"></p><h2 id="dramatic-differences-in-specificity-of-serum-neutralization-between-imprinted-adults-children-and-infants-with-just-a-single-xbb-infection" tabindex="-1">Dramatic differences in specificity of serum neutralization between imprinted adults/children and infants with just a single XBB* infection <a class="header-anchor" href="#dramatic-differences-in-specificity-of-serum-neutralization-between-imprinted-adults-children-and-infants-with-just-a-single-xbb-infection" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Dramatic differences in specificity of serum neutralization between imprinted adults/children and infants with just a single XBB* infection&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Bernadeta Dadonaite in our group compared these sera by using deep mutational scanning with pseudoviruses expressing the XBB.1.5 spike to examine which mutations reduced neutralization be each set of sera. She had <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07636-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">previously shown</a> that for imprinted adults, mutations at some key sites in the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) caused the most sera escape. In this new study, she found the same thing was true for imprinted children.</p><p>But when we performed the deep mutational scanning of the sera from the infants only infected by XBB*, we were stunned by what we found! The sites of strongest escape from the infant sera were not even in the RBD, but instead were in the spike N-terminal domain (NTD), as shown below:</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="dms_adult_child_infant"></p><p>As described in the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.17.633612v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">full paper</a>, this variation between the different sets of sera is in contrast to the differences between sera within the same set, where there is some variation but mostly sites of escape are roughly similar.</p><p>To validate the deep mutational scanning, we measured neutralization of XBB.1.5 spike-pseudovirus before and after depleting RBD-binding antibodies. Consistent with the deep mutational scanning, depleting RBD-binding antibodies greatly reduced neutralization by imprinted adult/children sera, but not XBB* infected infant sera.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="depletions_adult_child_infant.jpg"></p><p>These results imply SARS-CoV-2 mutations can have very different impacts on serum antibody neutralization depending on a person&#39;s exposure history. We used neutralization assays to confirm this fact for a subset of mutations as shown below.</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="validation_neuts.jpg"></p><h2 id="vaccination-boosts-rbd-targeting-for-infants" tabindex="-1">Vaccination boosts RBD targeting for infants <a class="header-anchor" href="#vaccination-boosts-rbd-targeting-for-infants" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Vaccination boosts RBD targeting for infants&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Subsequent vaccination of the XBB* infected infants does increase the RBD-directed neutralization of their sera, such that it strongly targets both the NTD and RBD. The reason is unclear, but we speculate it might be <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04060-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">affinity maturation of potent RBD antibodies</a>.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="dms_vax_infant.jpg"></p><h2 id="implications-for-viral-evolution" tabindex="-1">Implications for viral evolution <a class="header-anchor" href="#implications-for-viral-evolution" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Implications for viral evolution&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Overall, we think this heterogeneity among people could have substantial impacts on viral evolution. The evolutionary selection pressures on the virus become more complex if the same mutation only confers an antigenic benefit in a fraction of infected people.</p><p>Most prior studies of SARS-CoV-2 antigenic evolution have used sera mostly from imprinted adults. Yet the recent evolution of the virus has also seen selection for NTD mutations. Indeed, over the last five years spike mutations have been strongly selected in both RBD and NTD neutralizing antibody epitopes as shown below:</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="spike_muts.jpg"></p><h2 id="what-causes-the-differences-between-imprinted-individuals-and-singly-infected-infants" tabindex="-1">What causes the differences between imprinted individuals and singly infected infants? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-causes-the-differences-between-imprinted-individuals-and-singly-infected-infants" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What causes the differences between imprinted individuals and singly infected infants?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>We don&#39;t know the answer for certain!
