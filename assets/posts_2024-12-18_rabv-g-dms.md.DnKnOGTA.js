This study sheds light on mutational constraints on class III viral fusion proteins, suggests ways to stabilize G for vaccine antigens, and quantifies the robustness of antibodies (including ones being used or developed for clinical use) to rabies genetic variation.</p><hr><h2 id="background" tabindex="-1">Background <a class="header-anchor" href="#background" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Background&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Rabies virus infects many different mammalian species. In humans, rabies is lethal without post-exposure prophylaxis (which can take the form of serum or antibody administration) or vaccination. Roughly 60,000 people die annualy from rabies infections, with the highest toll in Africa and Asia. Efforts are underway to make new vaccines and develop antibody treatments, such as <a href="https://www.seruminstitute.com/product_ind_rabishield.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Rabishield</a>.</p><p>Vaccines and antibodies target G, which mediates viral receptor binding and cell entry. G is a class III fusion protein, which unlike the more heavily studies class I viral fusion proteins (eg, influenza HA or SARS-CoV-2 spike) undergo reversible conformational changes. However, this conformational flexibility can pose a challenge for vaccine design and antibody isolation: the most potent antibodies bind to prefusion G, but many antibodies elicited by native G bind to other conformations. As a result, one strategy for vaccine design is to stabilize the prefusion conformation of G.</p><h2 id="mutation-effects-on-cell-entry" tabindex="-1">Mutation effects on cell entry <a class="header-anchor" href="#mutation-effects-on-cell-entry" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Mutation effects on cell entry&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In our study, which was led by postdoc Arjun Aditham, we first measured how all G mutations affect cell entry using pseudoviruses, which are virions that can only undergo one round of infection and so offer a safe way to study viral mutations. The immediate result of these measurements is a huge heatmap of mutation effects, which is shown below but is best visualized interactively at <a href="https://dms-vep.org/RABV_Pasteur_G_DMS/cell_entry.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://dms-vep.org/RABV_Pasteur_G_DMS/cell_entry.html</a>.</p><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="cell_entry"></p><p>The mutational constraint can also be mapped on G&#39;s structure.

We first examined the frequency of escape mutations as measured in our deep mutational scanning for each antibody against all natural strains. As shown below (and interactively <a href="https://dms-vep.org/RABV_Pasteur_G_DMS/natural_seqs.html#escape-mutation-frequencies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>), escape mutations from all antibodies are present in natural strains, but their prevalence differs among antibodies.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="natural_escape"></p><p>We used the deep mutational scanning to predict escape from each antibody for all natural strains under an additive model of mutation effects.
