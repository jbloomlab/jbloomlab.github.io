The viral receptor-binding protein (RBP or G) attaches to host receptors and is a major target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we use deep mutational scanning to measure how all amino-acid mutations to the RBP affect cell entry, receptor binding, and escape from neutralizing antibodies. We identify functionally constrained regions of the RBP, including sites involved in oligomerization, along with mutations that differentially modulate RBP binding to its two ephrin receptors. We map escape mutations for six anti-RBP antibodies, and find that few antigenic mutations are present in natural Nipah strains. Our findings offer insights into the potential for functional and antigenic evolution of the RBP that can inform the development of antibody therapies and vaccines.</p><h2 id="interactive-visualizations" tabindex="-1">Interactive visualizations <a class="header-anchor" href="#interactive-visualizations" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Interactive visualizations&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The results described in this paper can be interactively visualized at <a href="https://dms-vep.org/Nipah_Malaysia_RBP_DMS/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://dms-vep.org/Nipah_Malaysia_RBP_DMS/</a></p>',4),o=[r];function s(l,c,p,d,h,u){return t(),e("div",null,o)}const m=a(n,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,m as default};
