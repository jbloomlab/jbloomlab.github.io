I recover the deleted files from the Google Cloud and reconstruct partial sequences of 13 early epidemic viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences in the context of carefully annotated existing data further supports the idea that the Huanan Seafood Market sequences are not fully representative of the viruses in Wuhan early in the epidemic. Instead, the progenitor of currently known SARS-CoV-2 sequences likely contained three mutations relative to the market viruses that made it more similar to SARS-CoV-2’s bat coronavirus relatives.",-1),l=[n,i];function d(c,h,m,p,u,_){return o(),t("div",null,l)}const y=a(s,[["render",d]]);export{b as __pageData,y as default};
