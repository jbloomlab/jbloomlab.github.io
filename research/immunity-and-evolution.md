We study immunity and viral evolution at both the population and single-cell levels.

At the population level, differences in exposure history and immune imprinting lead human individuals to make antibody responses that target different regions of rapidly evolving viruses like influenza and SARS-CoV-2. This population heterogeneity has profound implications for viral evolution and disease susceptibility, as it causes viral mutations to impact the immunity of different individuals differently. We are characterizing this population heterogeneity using both [deep mutational scanning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312824002336) and a [sequencing based-neutralization assay](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.08.584176) we developed that increases the throughput of traditional neutralization assays by several orders of magnitude (see schematic at left).

At the single-cell level, we developed approaches to [sequence viruses in single cells](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.00500-19) and [quantify how many progeny each infected cell produces](https://elifesciences.org/articles/86852). We use these approaches to understand how viral variation impacts the outcome of infection in individual cells.
