Our lab uses deep mutational scanning to experimentally measure how tens-of-thousands of mutations to viral proteins affect key properties including function, immune escape, and receptor binding.

We primarily perform these experiments using a [pseudovirus system](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867423001034) that allows us to safely characterize mutants of entry proteins from a wide range of viruses, including [SARS-CoV-2 spike](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07636-1), [influenza hemagglutinin](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.23.595634), [Lassa virus GPC](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761324003194), [HIV envelope](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1931312823002184), and [Nipah virus RBP](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.17.589977).

Deep mutational scanning can inform efforts to [forecast the evolution of human seasonal viruses](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07636-1) and [surveil the evolution of potential pandemic viruses](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.23.595634). To facilitate the use of deep mutational scanning for these important goals, we develop [interactive visualization tools](https://dms-viz.github.io/) and [data analysis pipelines](https://github.com/dms-vep/dms-vep-pipeline-3). See [here](https://dms-vep.org/Flu_H5_American-Wigeon_South-Carolina_2021-H5N1_DMS/) for an example of how we analyze and visualize large datasets to inform the study of viral evolution.
