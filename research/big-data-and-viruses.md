We also develop new ways to leverage large datasets to better understand viral evolution.

We have come up with a way to leverage the millions of publicly available SARS-CoV-2 sequences to estimate the effect of individual mutations on viral fitness (see [this paper](https://academic.oup.com/ve/article/9/2/vead055/7265011) and [these slides](https://slides.com/jbloom/sars2-mut-fitness/)). We've also created a platform to [visualize the mutational effects](https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS2-mut-fitness/) to aid in interpretation of viral evolution.

We have also integrated thousands of deep mutational scanning measurements into an [antibody-escape calculator](https://jbloomlab.github.io/SARS2-RBD-escape-calc/) that was [widely used](https://slides.com/jbloom/sars2-rbd-escape-calc#/12) during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic to understand the antigenic effects of viral mutations.

We also have projects that involve analyzing the evolution of viruses [within individual infected humans](https://elifesciences.org/articles/26875), and developing models to [understand epistasis among viral mutations](https://academic.oup.com/ve/article/8/2/veac110/6889254).
