In a new study led by Bernadeta Dadaonaite and [posted on bioRxiv today](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.18.671001), we used pseudovirus deep mutational scanning to understand how mutations affect the function and antigenicity of a recent SARS-CoV-2 variant that is fairly similar to those circulating right now.
