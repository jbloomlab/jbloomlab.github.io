## Here's a header

Here's some random **text** of *different* types that demonstrates [the different styles](https://vitepress.dev/guide/what-is-vitepress) and `elements` available in Markdown.

### Here's a smaller headers

This is what some subtext would look like. And a list with:

1. Some
2. Ordered
3. Elements

But, also a list with:

- Some
- Unordered
- Elements

## Another main header

You'll typically have more than one header in the document. This is another bit of text below a second main header.

What about images?

## A final header

Here's some code.

```js
var code = "some code is nice"
console.log(code)
```
