In a new study led by grad student Tim Yu and [posted on bioRxiv today](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.24.655919v1), we used pseudovirus deep mutational scanning to measure how all mutations to a recent H3N2 HA affect cell entry, stability, and antibody escape.
The results help shed light on how the pleiotropic effects of mutations shape influenza evolution.
