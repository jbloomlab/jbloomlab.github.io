title: Near real-time data on the human neutralizing antibody landscape to influenza virus to inform vaccine-strain selection in September 2025

In a new study led by Caroline Kikawa and [recently posted on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.06.674661v1), we use a new high-throughput method to measure ~26,000 neutralizing antibody titers that help capture the current human neutralizing antibody landscape to influenza.
We think these data can enable better evolutionary / epidemiological forecasting for purposes like influenza vaccine strain selection.

This dataset was posted in time for the upcoming Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine-strain selection, and represents a real tour de force effort by Caroline.
We're planning to repeat similar efforts in the next 6 months for the next vaccine-strain selection.
