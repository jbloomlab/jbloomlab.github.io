Here's a really solid example post. Lots of cool things to come.

## Cool Stuff

Woah, how neat! You must feel pretty blessed to be reading this interesting content. I spent a lot of time crafting it. Some might say *too much time*, but those people are just **haters**!

## More Cool Stuff

Wait, there's more?! You bet there is. I've got a lot more to talk about. A LOT more.

For example, here's some code that does something (*I think*):

```js
const myAmazingWebsite = new AmazingWebsite;
console.log(myAmazingWebsite)
```

But don't run that code. It will break EVERYTHING on your computer. That's not a good look.

### Other cool (but not quite as cool) stuff

You must be exhausted from all that excitement. It's hard to imagine how someone could cram so much life-changing content into one post. Only a genius like myself could make it happen.
