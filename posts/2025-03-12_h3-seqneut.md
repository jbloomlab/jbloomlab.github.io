In a new study [posted on bioRxiv today](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.04.641544v1), we used high-throughput sequencing-based neutralization assays to measure ~10,000 titers representing the ability of different human sera to neutralize different H3N2 influenza strains.
We then showed that these titers correlate with the actual evolutionary success of these viral strains in the real world, suggesting such experiments could be useful for helping inform vaccine-strain selection.

This study was the product of exciting work by Caroline Kikawa and Andrea Loes in our group to develop better ways to measure the ability of serum neutralization to many viral strains, and then apply that work to understand influenza evolution.

We are especially excited to continue the work with newer libraries and sera sets chosen on a timeline that can actually inform the twice-per-year influenza vaccine strain selection choices.
