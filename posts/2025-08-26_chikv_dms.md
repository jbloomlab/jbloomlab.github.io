In a new study led by Xiaohui Ju and [recently posted on bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.25.672233), we measure how mutations the Chikungunya virus envelope proteins affect entry in human vs mosquito cells.
The results help elucidate how this virus can infect cells from such diverse species, and enable us to create loss-of-tropism mutants that can only efficiently infect cells from one species.
