This document is an example of how markdown will get parsed and styled.

## Here's a header

Here's some random **text** of *different* types that demonstrates [the different styles](https://vitepress.dev/guide/what-is-vitepress) and `elements` available in Markdown.

### Here's a smaller headers

This is what some subtext would look like. And a list with:

1. Some
2. Ordered
3. Elements

But, also a list with:

- Some
- Unordered
- Elements

## Another main header

You'll typically have more than one header in the document. This is another bit of text below a second main header.

What about images?

![here's some alt text](../assets/papers/starr_greany_2020.png)

I'm not sure if the alt text will get rendered as a figure caption or not. It would be nice if it was parsed that way.

## A final header

I'm running out of ideas for what can go into a markdown file. I guess code is in markdown? 

```
var code = "some code is nice"
console.log(code)
```

So that's about it!
