As a Data Scientist in the Bloom Lab, I develop and implement computational approaches to study viral evolution and communicate with our data. Iâ€™m interested in improving access to the information-rich datasets we generate to aid in antigen engineering, therapeutic design, viral surveillance, and gaining a better understanding of viral evolution.
