Brendan Larsen is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Bloom lab, where he studies the functional and antigenic evolution of Nipah virus. He is broadly interested in zoonotic viruses, in particular, bat and rodent-borne viruses that could potentially spillover into humans. He is funded by the Washington Research Foundation.
